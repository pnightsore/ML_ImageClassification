# ML_ImageClassification
This project uses 4 CNN models made from scratch and each being a small improvement of the previous. and one model built on a pre-trained architecture called Xception to classify images of Chihuahua and Muffins.
I have focused on adding layers step by step and using hyper parameter tuning to demonstrate different models' performances and finally comparing the results with a model based upon pre-trained models.
